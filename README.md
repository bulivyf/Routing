INTRODUCTION
The code uses OpenLayer to present a map of the area west of DC.  The objective is to allow the user to click multiple consecuitive points to set lat, lon positions on the map.  Once a double click is made the application gathers all the poiints and calculates geospatial distances between each.  The code objective is to present a baseline for implementing direct line of site nearest neighbor and traveling salesmen algorithms (TODO).

The code is standalone and doesnt require a web server.  Simply extract to your machine, then double click on the index.html file.
