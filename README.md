INTRODUCTION
The code uses OpenLayer to present a map of the area west of DC that calculates geospatial distance between points.  To do this, the user should click multiple consecutive points to set lat, lon positions on the map.  Once a double click is made the application gathers all the poiints and calculates geospatial distances between each.  

OBJECTIVE
The objective is to present a baseline for implementing direct line of site nearest neighbor and traveling salesmen algorithms (TODO).

DEVELOPER NOTES
The code is standalone and doesnt require a web server.  Simply extract to your machine, then double click the index.html file.  Since its specifically for development purposes, you may benefit from viewing and interacting with the code via the developer console of your preferred web browser.
